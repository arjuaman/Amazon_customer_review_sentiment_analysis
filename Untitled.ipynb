      "Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.\n",
      "Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.\n",
      "Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review\n"

       "\"Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.\""
