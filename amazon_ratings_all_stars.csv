0,5,"I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it."
1,5,"Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money."
2,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
3,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review"
4,4,"Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
5,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
6,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
7,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
8,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."
9,1,"Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon)."

It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought.

It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."

122,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
123,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

158,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."

162,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
163,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
195,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
196,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
197,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
198,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."
199,1,"Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon)."
200,5,"I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it."

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money."
202,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
203,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review"
234,4,"Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
235,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
236,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
237,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
238,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."
239,1,"Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon)."

Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.

Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review"
274,4,"Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
275,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
276,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
277,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
278,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."
279,1,"Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon)."

No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.

In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS.

It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting.

352,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content .

353,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant.

The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax.

I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting.

392,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
393,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting.

432,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content .

433,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax.

I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting.

472,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content .

473,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax.

It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."

512,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
513,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

547,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
548,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."

552,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
553,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
585,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
586,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
587,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
588,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."
589,1,"Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon)."
590,5,"I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it."

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.

592,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
593,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review"
624,4,"Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
625,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
626,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
627,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
628,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."
629,1,"Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon)."

Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.

Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review"
664,4,"Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
665,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
666,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
667,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
668,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."
669,1,"Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling.

The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.

In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS.

708,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting.

742,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content .

743,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax.

It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting.

782,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
783,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax.

788,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use.

It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting.

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money."
822,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
823,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review"
824,4,"Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
825,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
826,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
827,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
828,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."

862,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content .

863,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax.

It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."

902,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
903,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax.

937,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
938,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."

942,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
943,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
975,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
976,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
977,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
978,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."
979,1,"Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon)."
980,5,"I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it."

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money."
982,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
983,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax.

1014,4,"Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time."
1015,1,"I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense"
1016,1,"Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible."
1017,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
1018,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."

I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge.

I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen.

This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting.

1169,5,This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.
1170,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already."
1171,1,"Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back.

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.

1173,2,Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.
1174,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone.

1190,5,"I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it."

1200,1,"This phone has Exynos NOT snapdragon. It is an international version and does not work with my straighttalk SIM card. First, it doesn't connect to my mobile data, I had to add an Access Point Name so that the data would work. Second, the calls will not work unless the ""wifi calling"" is on. Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"". I also can't send pictures AT ALL, and my texts randomly won't send."
1201,1,"Device is not a factory unlocked device as mentioned in the seller description, and contained a T-Mobile documentation/boot screen.  Upon booting, I was notified that the device had been reset (it was listed as new and unactivated), and I would need to log in under the account previously used for the device.  Customer service did respond within minutes to my email explaining the situation, which is a good sign, but now I have to call during my work hours to get everything straightened out.  They recommended a hard reset and sent a video explaining how to do so, but nothing has worked so far. Many recent comments appear to have similar issues."
1202,1,"BUYER BEWARE. First, unless you live in a city that has GREAT cell signal, DON'T buy this. My $100 phone had MUCH better signal. I will likely sell this one just because it's no good if you need a cellphone.Second: The phone worked well for 3 months, then part of the display stopped working. When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in. She did say that if there was a sign of water damage the warranty would be void (we live in A VERY humid climate: great). They fixed it under warranty, as it had 3 things wrong."
1203,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1204,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1205,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call?

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1207,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

1213,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1214,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1215,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!!

1243,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

1244,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1245,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"
1246,2,"This is the second review I've made. Along with receiving my phone a week after it was expected, it came straight from the box with chinks in the screen and the screen is so fragile that almost every day a new dent shows up in the screen from just sitting in my pocket (with a case) I don't move around too much. I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1247,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"".

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1277,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

1283,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast!

1284,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1285,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.

1314,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1315,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"".

1322,1,"BUYER BEWARE. First, unless you live in a city that has GREAT cell signal, DON'T buy this. My $100 phone had MUCH better signal.

When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in.

1353,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1354,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1355,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1385,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"".

1392,1,"BUYER BEWARE. First, unless you live in a city that has GREAT cell signal, DON'T buy this. My $100 phone had MUCH better signal. I will likely sell this one just because it's no good if you need a cellphone.Second: The phone worked well for 3 months, then part of the display stopped working. When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in. She did say that if there was a sign of water damage the warranty would be void (we live in A VERY humid climate: great). They fixed it under warranty, as it had 3 things wrong."
1393,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse.

Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

1423,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse.

Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

1424,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1425,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1455,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"
1456,2,"This is the second review I've made. Along with receiving my phone a week after it was expected, it came straight from the box with chinks in the screen and the screen is so fragile that almost every day a new dent shows up in the screen from just sitting in my pocket (with a case) I don't move around too much. I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1457,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"
1458,1,"Just like many other orders, I received the wrong model number.I purchased the advertised model: SM-G973UZKAXAA, but was sent: SM-G973U1ZKAX.Just like the other reviewers stated, even though the models seem similar they are in fact different. The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first... A big mistake!Amazon should check the bar code before sending the wrong order to this many people.I am currently awaiting a replacement, since I did want an S10 as my primary phone."

1460,1,"This phone has Exynos NOT snapdragon. It is an international version and does not work with my straighttalk SIM card.

Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"". I also can't send pictures AT ALL, and my texts randomly won't send."
1461,1,"Device is not a factory unlocked device as mentioned in the seller description, and contained a T-Mobile documentation/boot screen.

Customer service did respond within minutes to my email explaining the situation, which is a good sign, but now I have to call during my work hours to get everything straightened out.

1462,1,"BUYER BEWARE. First, unless you live in a city that has GREAT cell signal, DON'T buy this. My $100 phone had MUCH better signal. I will likely sell this one just because it's no good if you need a cellphone.Second: The phone worked well for 3 months, then part of the display stopped working. When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in. She did say that if there was a sign of water damage the warranty would be void (we live in A VERY humid climate: great). They fixed it under warranty, as it had 3 things wrong."
1463,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

1493,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1494,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1495,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone.

If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price.

1525,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

1563,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1564,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1565,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1567,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX.

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

1595,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"
1596,2,"This is the second review I've made.

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1597,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first... A big mistake!Amazon should check the bar code before sending the wrong order to this many people.I am currently awaiting a replacement, since I did want an S10 as my primary phone."

1602,1,"BUYER BEWARE. First, unless you live in a city that has GREAT cell signal, DON'T buy this. My $100 phone had MUCH better signal. I will likely sell this one just because it's no good if you need a cellphone.Second: The phone worked well for 3 months, then part of the display stopped working. When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in. She did say that if there was a sign of water damage the warranty would be void (we live in A VERY humid climate: great). They fixed it under warranty, as it had 3 things wrong."
1603,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1604,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less.

After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment.

I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1667,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty??

The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in.

1673,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast!

I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price.

When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either?

1703,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1704,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1705,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1707,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX.

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1737,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

1743,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1744,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1745,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything.

1773,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1774,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1775,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"
1776,2,"This is the second review I've made. Along with receiving my phone a week after it was expected, it came straight from the box with chinks in the screen and the screen is so fragile that almost every day a new dent shows up in the screen from just sitting in my pocket (with a case) I don't move around too much. I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1777,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"
1778,1,"Just like many other orders, I received the wrong model number.I purchased the advertised model: SM-G973UZKAXAA, but was sent: SM-G973U1ZKAX.Just like the other reviewers stated, even though the models seem similar they are in fact different. The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first... A big mistake!Amazon should check the bar code before sending the wrong order to this many people.I am currently awaiting a replacement, since I did want an S10 as my primary phone."

Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"".

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
1807,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"
1808,1,"Just like many other orders, I received the wrong model number.I purchased the advertised model: SM-G973UZKAXAA, but was sent: SM-G973U1ZKAX.Just like the other reviewers stated, even though the models seem similar they are in fact different. The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first... A big mistake!Amazon should check the bar code before sending the wrong order to this many people.I am currently awaiting a replacement, since I did want an S10 as my primary phone."

1813,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1814,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1815,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.

You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

1844,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1845,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in.

While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

1883,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1884,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1885,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

1914,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1915,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"
1916,2,"This is the second review I've made.

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"".

1922,1,"BUYER BEWARE. First, unless you live in a city that has GREAT cell signal, DON'T buy this. My $100 phone had MUCH better signal. I will likely sell this one just because it's no good if you need a cellphone.Second: The phone worked well for 3 months, then part of the display stopped working. When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in. She did say that if there was a sign of water damage the warranty would be void (we live in A VERY humid climate: great). They fixed it under warranty, as it had 3 things wrong."
1923,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse.

Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders).

1953,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
1954,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1955,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"
1956,2,"This is the second review I've made.

I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
1985,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone.

1992,1,"BUYER BEWARE. First, unless you live in a city that has GREAT cell signal, DON'T buy this. My $100 phone had MUCH better signal. I will likely sell this one just because it's no good if you need a cellphone.Second: The phone worked well for 3 months, then part of the display stopped working. When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in. She did say that if there was a sign of water damage the warranty would be void (we live in A VERY humid climate: great). They fixed it under warranty, as it had 3 things wrong."
1993,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse.

Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

2023,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
2024,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
2025,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
2055,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone.

So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in.

2063,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse.

Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

2093,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
2094,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
2095,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
2097,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX.

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

2125,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count.

It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.

I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in.

2133,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less.

2163,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
2164,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
2165,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
2167,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX.

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
2197,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"

The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in.

2203,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast!

2204,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price.

2233,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
2234,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
2235,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
2237,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX.

The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.

2267,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"

2273,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
2274,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
2275,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything.

2303,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model.

2304,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
2305,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"
2306,2,"This is the second review I've made. Along with receiving my phone a week after it was expected, it came straight from the box with chinks in the screen and the screen is so fragile that almost every day a new dent shows up in the screen from just sitting in my pocket (with a case) I don't move around too much. I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
2307,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"
2308,1,"Just like many other orders, I received the wrong model number.I purchased the advertised model: SM-G973UZKAXAA, but was sent: SM-G973U1ZKAX.Just like the other reviewers stated, even though the models seem similar they are in fact different. The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first...

Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"".

I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
2337,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"
2338,1,"Just like many other orders, I received the wrong model number.I purchased the advertised model: SM-G973UZKAXAA, but was sent: SM-G973U1ZKAX.Just like the other reviewers stated, even though the models seem similar they are in fact different. The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first... A big mistake!Amazon should check the bar code before sending the wrong order to this many people.I am currently awaiting a replacement, since I did want an S10 as my primary phone."

2343,3,"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
2344,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
2345,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.

You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version."
2374,4,"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.Pros- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.Cons-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery."
2375,4,"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time.  Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom.  I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone!  Whoever made that decision should be fired.  Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too.  I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function.  So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!"
2376,2,"This is the second review I've made. Along with receiving my phone a week after it was expected, it came straight from the box with chinks in the screen and the screen is so fragile that almost every day a new dent shows up in the screen from just sitting in my pocket (with a case) I don't move around too much. I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much"
2377,2,"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone. The phone I was supposed to get is the US version, which comes with a 12-month limited warranty. The phone that I received is the international version. It is not covered by a warranty in the US.Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!"
2378,1,"Just like many other orders, I received the wrong model number.I purchased the advertised model: SM-G973UZKAXAA, but was sent: SM-G973U1ZKAX.Just like the other reviewers stated, even though the models seem similar they are in fact different. The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first... A big mistake!Amazon should check the bar code before sending the wrong order to this many people.I am currently awaiting a replacement, since I did want an S10 as my primary phone."
2379,1,This was not factory sealed and was not unlocked by Samsung. There was a piece of shipping tape used to keep the box together.
2380,1,"This phone has Exynos NOT snapdragon. It is an international version and does not work with my straighttalk SIM card. First, it doesn't connect to my mobile data, I had to add an Access Point Name so that the data would work. Second, the calls will not work unless the ""wifi calling"" is on. Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"". I also can't send pictures AT ALL, and my texts randomly won't send."
2381,1,"Device is not a factory unlocked device as mentioned in the seller description, and contained a T-Mobile documentation/boot screen.  Upon booting, I was notified that the device had been reset (it was listed as new and unactivated), and I would need to log in under the account previously used for the device.  Customer service did respond within minutes to my email explaining the situation, which is a good sign, but now I have to call during my work hours to get everything straightened out.  They recommended a hard reset and sent a video explaining how to do so, but nothing has worked so far. Many recent comments appear to have similar issues."
2382,1,"BUYER BEWARE. First, unless you live in a city that has GREAT cell signal, DON'T buy this. My $100 phone had MUCH better signal. I will likely sell this one just because it's no good if you need a cellphone.Second: The phone worked well for 3 months, then part of the display stopped working. When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in. She did say that if there was a sign of water damage the warranty would be void (we live in A VERY humid climate: great). They fixed it under warranty, as it had 3 things wrong."
