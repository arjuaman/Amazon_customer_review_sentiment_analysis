  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  Watch out for green/ red tint issues on the display.Screen also has issues with losing details on dark scenes in Netflix  with HDR content . OnePlus says the issues will be fixed with a software update.Phone is fast. Screen display looks amazing except for those above flaws . Camera is fine . Blue is beautiful.

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

  Really love the design of the phone. Reminds me of the Samsung S10 series a lot with the hole punch design and curved display. Customization is incredible with this phone, along with the beautiful display. So far this phone is pretty good!P.S. I've been reading some bad reviews on Amazon... Don't listen to them. This phone does not come with Alexa from Amazon. Sure it advertises that it uses the assistant, but it's only optional as you have to manually download the Alexa app to use as an assistant. I've been using Google this whole time.

  I have a OnePlus 3 / OnePlus 6 and was about to have a OnePlus 8 Pro. The dual-SIM is a primary feature for me, and I discovered that OnePlus8 does not handle DualSIM for now due to software issues, I'll wait another few days and then return it if nothing change, lost 1hour transferring data for nothing.Releasing a phone before it is ready makes no sense

  Color black only available in the 8 Pro model or the regular 8 model but on Verizon or T mobile.  Regular 8 model unlocked is only available in green or the interstellar glow (mostly pink).  Also, if you by the unlocked models from amazon then you get Alexa built in.  So if you don’t want Alexa you have to buy from OP direct.  Way to go oneplus.  Fragment your lineup to the N’th degree.  Horrible.

  This phone is so much better in photographic quality then my Galaxy Note 10+ and my fiancé’s IPhone X Max. I’m so happy really.

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

  Beware if you’re thinking about buying this phone, if you need to return it you won’t get your money back. I returned mine to amazon and now they’re stating the wrong item was shipped to them and that they needed to discard it. Amazon themselves don’t know what they’re selling. The phone does not come with Alexa built in despite what the description says. Now I’m out $1000 and Amazon gets to keep my phone.Great phone but did not fully work with my carrier (Verizon).
